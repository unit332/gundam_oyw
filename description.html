<br>Introduction
<br>The One Year War - the most bloody war in history within the first few weeks.
<br>
<br>Credits to the TripleA devs, forum moderators, and mod makers who were all helpful directly and indirectly. A lot of this code was built off of re-existing mods.
<br>Battle, movement, and alarm sound credit to Laplus White on Youtube, who uploaded a lot of sounds I used to make the mod sound right.
